    abstract = {Abstract Natural language processing techniques can be used to analyze the linguistic content of a document to extract missing pieces of metadata. However, accurate metadata extraction may not depend solely on the linguistics, but also on structural problems such as extremely large documents, unordered multi-file documents, and inconsistency in manually labeled metadata. In this work, we start from two standard machine learning solutions to extract pieces of metadata from Environmental Impact Statements, environmental policy documents that are regularly produced under the US National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. We present a series of experiments where we evaluate how these standard approaches are affected by different issues derived from real-world data. We find that metadata extraction can be strongly influenced by nonlinguistic factors such as document length and volume ordering and that the standard machine learning solutions often do not scale well to long documents. We demonstrate how such solutions can be better adapted to these scenarios, and conclude with suggestions for other NLP practitioners cataloging large document collections.},

This is a slow and tedious task, and one which does not scale well.Here we propose an interactive tool that allows a taxonomy to be built or extended \textit{rapidly} and with a \textit{human in the loop} to control precision. We apply insights from text summarization and information extraction to reduce the search space dramatically, then leverage modern pretrained language models to perform contextualized clustering of the remaining concepts to yield candidate nodes for the user to review. We show this allows a user to consider as many as 200 taxonomy concept candidates an hour, to quickly build or extend a taxonomy to better fit information needs.",

We show that the most realistic settings for clinical use cases are seriously under-studied. To support research in these important directions, we make a series of recommendations, not just for domain adaptation but for clinical NLP in general, that ensure that data, shared tasks, and released models are broadly useful, and that initiate research directions where the clinical NLP community can lead the broader NLP and machine learning fields.}",

However, geographical locations occur not only as individual toponyms, but also as compositions of reference geolocations joined and modified by connectives, e.g., {``}. . . between the towns of Adrano and S.Maria di Licodia, 32 kilometres northwest of Catania{''}. Ideally, a geoparser should be able to take such text, and the geographical shapes of the toponyms referenced within it, and parse these into a geographical shape, formed by a set of coordinates, that represents the location described. But creating a dataset for this complex geoparsing task is difficult and, if done manually, would require a huge amount of effort to annotate the geographical shapes of not only the geolocation described but also the reference toponyms. We present an approach that automates most of the process by combining Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. As a result, we have gathered a collection of 360,187 uncurated complex geolocation descriptions, from which we have manually curated 1,000 examples intended to be used as a test set. To accompany the data, we define a new geoparsing evaluation framework along with a scoring methodology and a set of baselines.",

We analyze the sources of these improvements, and find that pre-trained contextual character embeddings are more robust to term variations, infrequent terms, and cross-domain changes.

INDRA aggregates multiple sources of causal information and performs assembly to create a coherent knowledge base and assess its reliability.

    abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to extract ordered timelines of events, their participants, locations and times from a set of Multilingual and Cross-lingual data sources. Based on the assumption that event-related information can be recovered from different documents written in different languages, we extend the Cross-document Event Ordering task presented at SemEval 2015 by specifying two new tasks for, respectively, Multilingual and Cross-lingual timeline extraction. We then develop three deterministic algorithms for timeline extraction based on two main ideas. First, we address implicit temporal relations at document level since explicit time-anchors are too scarce to build a wide coverage timeline extraction system. Second, we leverage several multilingual resources to obtain a single, interoperable, semantic representation of events across documents and across languages. The result is a highly competitive system that strongly outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Nonetheless, further analysis of the results reveals that linking the event mentions with their target entities and time-anchors remains a difficult challenge. The systems, resources and scorers are freely available to facilitate its use and guarantee the reproducibility of results.},

    abstract = {In this article, we describe a system that reads news articles in four different languages and detects what happened, who is involved, where and when. This event-centric information is represented as episodic situational knowledge on individuals in an interoperable RDF format that allows for reasoning on the implications of the events. Our system covers the complete path from unstructured text to structured knowledge, for which we defined a formal model that links interpreted textual mentions of things to their representation as instances. The model forms the skeleton for interoperable interpretation across different sources and languages. The real content, however, is defined using multilingual and cross-lingual knowledge resources, both semantic and episodic. We explain how these knowledge resources are used for the processing of text and ultimately define the actual content of the episodic situational knowledge that is reported in the news. The knowledge and model in our system can be seen as an example how the Semantic Web helps NLP. However, our systems also generate massive episodic knowledge of the same type as the Semantic Web is built on. We thus envision a cycle of knowledge acquisition and NLP improvement on a massive scale. This article reports on the details of the system but also on the performance of various high-level components. We demonstrate that our system performs at state-of-the-art level for various subtasks in the four languages of the project, but that we also consider the full integration of these tasks in an overall system with the purpose of reading text. We applied our system to millions of news articles, generating billions of triples expressing formal semantic properties. This shows the capacity of the system to perform at an unprecedented scale.},

Our proposal defines a set of automatic methods for mapping the semantic knowledge included in WordNet, VerbNet, PropBank and FrameNet. We use advanced graph-based word sense disambiguation algorithms and corpus alignment methods to automatically establish the appropriate mappings among their lexical entries and roles. We study different settings for each method using SemLink as a gold-standard for evaluation. The results show that the new approach provides productive and reliable mappings. In fact, the mappings obtained automatically outnumber the set of original mappings in SemLink. Finally, we also present a new version of the Predicate Matrix, a lexical-semantic resource resulting from the integration of the mappings obtained by our automatic methods and SemLink.},

    abstract = "This paper presents a novel automatic approach to partially integrate FrameNet and WordNet. In that way we expect to extend FrameNet coverage, to enrich WordNet with frame semantic information and possibly to extend FrameNet to languages other than English. The method uses a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm for matching the FrameNet lexical units to WordNet synsets. Specifically, we exploit a graph-based Word Sense Disambiguation algorithm that uses a large-scale knowledge-base derived from existing semantic resources. We have developed and tested additional versions of this algorithm showing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art results. Finally, we show some examples and figures of the resulting semantic resource.",

    abstract = "This paper presents the complete and consistent ontological annotation of the nominal part of WordNet. The annotation has been carried out using the semantic features defined in the EuroWordNet Top Concept Ontology and made available to the NLP community. Up to now only an initial core set of 1,024 synsets, the so-called Base Concepts, was ontologized in such a way. The work has been achieved by following a methodology based on an iterative and incremental expansion of the initial labeling through the hierarchy while setting inheritance blockage points. Since this labeling has been set on the EuroWordNetÂs Interlingual Index (ILI), it can be also used to populate any other wordnet linked to it through a simple porting process. This feature-annotated WordNet is intended to be useful for a large number of semantic NLP tasks and for testing for the first time componential analysis on real environments. Moreover, the quantitative analysis of the work shows that more than 40{\%} of the nominal part of WordNet is involved in structure errors or inadequacies.",
