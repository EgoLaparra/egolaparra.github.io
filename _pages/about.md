<h2> Welcome </h2>

Iâ€™m a Researcher/Scientist at <a href='https://ischool.arizona.edu/'>The University of Arizona School of Information</a>. Previously, I worked as a Postdoctoral Associate at the same university from 2017 to 2021, after receiving my PhD from the <a href='https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/informatika-fakultatea/home'>University of the Basque Country</a>.
<br>
<br>
My background is in computer science with a specialization in natural language processing. My research interests include information extraction with a focus on the events, their participants, and their context, i.e., when and where the events take place. I also work on domain adaptation searching for solutions to transfer machine learning models across domains. I am especially interested on applying such techniques to clinical documents.
